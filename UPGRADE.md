# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading To 0.9 From 0.8

### Provider Options API

**Likelihood Of Impact: High**

The `providerOptions()` method on embeddings and transcription builders has been
removed in favor of `withProviderOptions()`:

```php
// Before...
Ai::embeddings('...')->providerOptions(['dimensions' => 256]);

// After...
Ai::embeddings('...')->withProviderOptions(['dimensions' => 256]);
```

The `withProviderOptions()` signature on provider tools has also changed. The
`Lab|string $provider` argument was dropped in favor of an array or closure:

```php
// Before...
$tool->withProviderOptions('openai', ['key' => 'value']);

// After...
$tool->withProviderOptions(['key' => 'value']);

// Or, to vary options per provider, pass a closure...
$tool->withProviderOptions(fn (Lab|string $provider) => match ($provider) {
    Lab::OpenAi => ['key' => 'value'],
    default => [],
});
```

### The `TextGateway` Contract Was Removed

**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

`Laravel\Ai\Contracts\Gateway\TextGateway` has been removed. Provider gateways
now implement only `StepTextGateway`, and the multi-step API lives entirely on
the provider's `TextGenerationLoop`. Most applications are unaffected.

If you wrote or type-hinted a custom gateway, swap the contract:

```php
// Before...
use Laravel\Ai\Contracts\Gateway\TextGateway;

class MyGateway implements TextGateway { /* generateText, streamText, onToolInvocation */ }

// After...
use Laravel\Ai\Contracts\Gateway\StepTextGateway;

class MyGateway implements StepTextGateway { /* generateTextStep, generateStreamStep */ }
```

The multi-step methods you used to call on the gateway now live on the loop:

```php
// Before...
$provider->textGateway()->generateText(...);
$provider->textGateway()->onToolInvocation(...);

// After...
$provider->textGenerationLoop()->generate(...);
$provider->textGenerationLoop()->onToolInvocation(...);
```

If you implement `TextProvider` directly instead of extending the base
`Provider`, add a `textGenerationLoop(): TextGenerationLoop` method. Anything
extending `Provider` gets it for free.

### Faked Responses Now Run Through The Real Loop

**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

`Agent::fake()` responses now flow through the same `TextGenerationLoop` as real
providers. Existing tests keep passing, but if you assert on exact messages or
streamed events, four behaviors are now more realistic:

- Faking a tool call for a tool the agent has not registered throws
  `NoSuchToolException` instead of being silently skipped. Register the tool.
- After a faked tool call, `$response->messages` includes the final assistant
  reply (one extra message). `text`, `toolCalls`, `toolResults`, and `steps`
  are unchanged.
- Faking an empty string no longer emits `TextStart` / `TextEnd` events while
  streaming.
- Faked tool calls now emit a `ToolCall` event while streaming. If you count
  streamed events, expect one extra per tool call.

### Native Anthropic Structured Outputs

**Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

Anthropic structured outputs now use the native `output_config.format` API by
default instead of the synthetic tool approach. To restore the previous
behavior, disable it in your provider configuration:

```php
'anthropic' => [
    'use_native_structured_output' => false,
],
```

### Agent Responses Are Now Responsable

**Likelihood Of Impact: Medium**

`AgentResponse` now implements `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Responsable`, so
returning it directly from a controller renders a JSON payload instead of the
agent's reply as plain text:

```php
// Before: the response body was the reply text (text/html)...
return $agent->forUser($user)->prompt('Summarize this order');

// After: the response body is JSON...
// {"status": "complete", "conversation_id": "...", "reply": "..."}
return $agent->forUser($user)->prompt('Summarize this order');
```

When the run pauses for tool approval, the body is
`{"status": "awaiting_approval", "conversation_id": "...", "approvals": [...]}`.
If you relied on the previous plain-text rendering, return the reply explicitly:

```php
return response((string) $response);
```

`StructuredAgentResponse` continues to render its structured payload as JSON, so
structured-output endpoints are unaffected.
